# Week 2 challenge

## Description

This project hits multiple concepts that help shape a new developer. It has allowed us to deepen our skills in web development by using HTML and CSS together to make a portfolio from scratch, in addition to making sure that we had a responsive layout that adapts to the user's viewport. The ultimate goal was to create a place for our future employers to see our work.

## Motivation

Here is a list of my motivations for this project!

- Gain a better understanding for @media in CSS and how it can be utilized
- Develop a sense for how I wanted to be seen as a developer
- Explore different ways to achieve a layout that fits my needs
- To present a project that I was able to build from scratch and show it to the world
